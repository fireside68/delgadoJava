  As of today, I posted an incomplete version of a Blackjack game our class is working on for a final project.  It currently consists of four classes:  Blackjack (main), Table (where the GUI is built), Cards (the card images and point values), and Dealer (handles Table, deals cards, keeps score).  The latest edit saw an attempt to include visuals that display depending on whether the game is won or lost.  Issues still present include:
    - the game doesn't end when the bank reaches zero
    - freezing issues after wins
    - massive lack of comments
